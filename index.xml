      <description>PyCharm As a Python developer you are probably familiar with PyCharm, an amazing IDE from JetBrains. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about it, have a look, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably not regret it :) Some of the steps in this article will make mention of PyCharm, however, it&amp;rsquo;s not required and you can still follow if you&amp;rsquo;re using another IDE. If you&amp;rsquo;re not using any IDE, well, god save your soul.</description>

      <description>In this post, we will make use of NodeJS and Docker to provide and API which interfaces with an Elasticsearch instance in AWS.
Assuming you already have an AWS account, and aws-cli set up.
Process  Write the NodeJS app locally Wrap it a docker image and deploy this image to a registry (we will use docker hub here) Use AWS ECS (EC2 Container Service) to deploy and scale your app in the cloud.</description>
